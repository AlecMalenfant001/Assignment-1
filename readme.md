# Solutions to Intro to AI Assignment 01

## By Alec Malenfant

## Overview

This repository is my solutions to the first assignment in PNW's CS 46200 Intro to Artificial Intelligence course. This is a collection of 3 programs that all deal with data processing. Assignment 1 finds the absolute difference of a given matrix using numpy. Assignment 2 find the sum of the even numbers of the fibonacci sequence that are <100,000. Finally, Assignment 3 displays data from [this](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris) dataset using matplotlib and panda among other libraries.

The read me files for each program are shown below:
